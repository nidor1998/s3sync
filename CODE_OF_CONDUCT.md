# Code of Conduct

This project adheres to the [Rust Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).

## Contributing

While this project began as a personal hobby, it has been built with careful attention to production-quality standards.

- Suggestions and bug reports are welcome, but responses are not guaranteed.
- Pull requests for new features are generally not accepted, as they may conflict with the design philosophy.
- If you find this project useful, feel free to fork and modify it as you wish.

🔒 I consider this project to be “complete” and will maintain it only minimally going forward.  
However, I intend to keep the AWS SDK for Rust and other dependencies up to date monthly.
